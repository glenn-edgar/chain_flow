This directory contains examples on the use of chain flow for various class of problems.
To execute examples do
  python3  "example.py"

Examples are written in python 3 and will not run in python 2.

The examples are as follows:



chain_control_test_py3.py  -- shows the use of the enable, disable, suspend and resume chain opcodes.


chain_functions_py3.py  -- this file show how a add user defined functions which are actived when a chain
                           is enabled and disabled

clusters_py3.py  -- this file shows the use of clusters. Clusters are a chain flow add on which allows
                    complicated state machine like structures to be created

one_step_event_functions_py3.py  -- this file shows the use of the one_step and event opcodes

return_code_test_py3.py   -- this file shows the use of the return opcodes

runtime_functions_py3.py  -- this file shows the use of the chain flow runtime functions
                             within the use of of a user defined python function

verify_functions_test_py3.py -- this file shows the use of the verify opcodes

wait_functions_test_py3.py  -- this file shows the use of the wait opcodes
